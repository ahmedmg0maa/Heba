# Final preproduction audit and score — 2026-08-27

## Final decision

# `BLOCKED`

The current Code X worktree is stronger and locally reproducible, but it is not Staging-accepted. The exact current release is not deployed to the separate Worker; recovery/restore and the Supabase Staging schema/Auth/RLS journey have not run; owner content/legal approval and Resend/Sentry proof are absent. Production and DNS remain untouched.

## Acceptance score

This is an evidence score, not a design score. Local evidence can improve a local category but receives no live-environment points.

| Axis | Weight | Current points | Evidence/remaining deduction |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| End-to-end journeys | 15 | 6 | 52/52 ordinary and 52/52 Worker public tests; authenticated Admin→customer→operations chain unverified |
| Frontend/UX/RTL/accessibility | 10 | 9 | Arabic RTL, desktop/390/768 geometry, keyboard start journey, focus/skip/reduced motion; no Staging axe/manual screen-reader/200% proof |
| Backend/API/business logic | 10 | 8 | source contracts and denial paths pass; no real provider database execution |
| Database integrity/performance | 10 | 5 | ordered migrations and validators pass locally; 044–047 schema/RLS/RPC/concurrency unverified on Staging |
| Auth/Authz/security/privacy | 12 | 9 | permissions, fresh AAL2 source paths, secret/archive audits pass; live redirect/MFA/session/RLS evidence absent |
| Admin operational control | 12 | 10 | structured home/journey/catalog, reports, revisions, preview, agenda and audit controls; real persistence/public impact rehearsal absent |
| Booking/payment/Storage/access | 12 | 5 | strong local booking/commerce/delivery contracts; no Staging proof/entitlement journey |
| Hosting/CDN/WAF | 6 | 2 | current vinext Worker parity passes locally; current remote deployment/cache/WAF/log evidence absent |
| Monitoring/recovery/backups | 8 | 1 | fail-closed tooling exists; no backup/restore, email or monitoring proof |
| Performance/SEO/release quality | 5 | 4 | isolated builds, noindex/crawl/route/archive audits pass; no Staging Lighthouse or field evidence |
| **Official total** | **100** | **59/100** | Staging P0 gates remain missing |

Quality of local implementation is assessed separately as **91/100**; Production readiness remains **38/100**. Neither number overrides the official verdict.

## Executed PASS

- `pnpm check:deploy`: type generation/check, lint, archive/delivery/booking/CMS/report/search/start/catalog/revision/Admin-UX contracts, isolated Next build, **52/52** public Playwright, and every route/UX/color/security/Admin/media/commerce/catalog/booking/database/launch audit.
- `pnpm test:e2e:cloudflare`: isolated vinext/Workers build and **52/52** desktop/mobile tests with retries disabled after fixing the hydration readiness race.
- `pnpm package:release`: **463** recursively inspected files with no local secret/build/test artifact; the local archive was not uploaded, followed by a final security-audit pass.
- local Worker uses the project-derived Worker names, compatibility date/flag and generated Wrangler configuration; no `.env` inheritance.

## Failed and corrected

- First current Worker E2E run: **50/52**, failing the same start-journey keyboard assertion on desktop and mobile before client hydration.
- Correction: explicit client-effect hydration signal plus deterministic wait; no retry or weakened assertion.
- Recheck: type-check, lint, start-journey source contract and rebuilt Worker **52/52 PASS**.

## Environment-blocked / owner-provider required

1. secure Full Logical Backup + isolated Restore Drill;
2. distinct Staging baseline/fingerprint and 044 → 045 → 046 → 047 only on Staging;
3. RLS/RPC/Auth redirects/disposable Admin MFA and two-user data isolation;
4. current branch publication to the separate protected Worker, GitHub Builds identity and runtime/log checks;
5. real synthetic booking/manual-payment/entitlement/Storage/email/Sentry E2E;
6. factual content, media rights, services/prices/availability and legal approvals;
7. Staging Lighthouse/axe/manual accessibility and launch rehearsal.

## Path to 100/100

- Recovery and Staging schema/Auth/RLS gate: +15.
- Current Worker remote runtime and provider integration proof: +8.
- Full authenticated Admin→public→customer→operations E2E: +10.
- Owner content/legal/media-rights acceptance: +4.
- Accessibility/performance/SEO/operations rehearsal with no P0/P1 failure: +4.

These 41 points are awarded only when their environment-specific acceptance tests pass, yielding 100/100 from the current 59. No Production proposal may begin merely because the local builds pass.

## Single next external action

Configure `HEBA_LAUNCH_PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` directly in the secure executor environment—never in chat, GitHub or a repository file—and confirm only that the variable is present. This unlocks the approved full logical backup and isolated restore drill. It does not authorize Production migration, DNS, deployment or any other Production write.
