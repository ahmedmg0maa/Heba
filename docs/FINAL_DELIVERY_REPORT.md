# FINAL DELIVERY REPORT — V2.5.0

> **Hosting supersession — 2026-08-26:** this historical implementation report no longer defines the launch host. The final architecture is GitHub Free + Cloudflare Workers Free + separate Supabase Production/Staging projects; see `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md`, and `PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_CLOSURE_2026-08-26.md`.

**Project:** منصة هبة الشريف — premium Arabic-first learning platform
**Delivered:** 2026-07-10 · 20 versioned phases (V0.1.0 → V2.0.0), every phase gated by `pnpm check:deploy`

## What was built

### Public website (S1/S2)
RTL-first luxury design: two-tier editorial header, human-free typographic hero, original botanical filigree, trust rail, service/journey/editorial still-life sections, live offer, testimonials and newsletter; discovery pages with original no-person photographic card crops, category strips, comparison and CTA systems; full dark mode; detail/editorial/legal routes and custom 404.

### Commerce (§8 implemented exactly)
Unified checkout `/checkout/[type]/[slug]`: server-trusted pricing → offers/coupons recomputed server-side; manual payment flow (Instapay/wallet/bank from site_settings — unconfigured methods hidden), private proof upload, `awaiting_review` transition, admin approval queue with signed proof preview; approve → paid + automatic access grants (courses/books/workshops/bundles) + notification + audit; reject → reason shown to customer + re-upload; 72h expiry enforced at read AND hourly via pg_cron.

### Customer dashboard + LMS (S4)
11 routes: overview (greeting, streak day-dots, achievements, continue-learning, upcoming session), courses with progress, books library, workshops, bookings, orders, payment timeline, notifications with mark-read, profile, settings. LMS player: signed-URL playback (enrollment/preview-gated), curriculum accordion with per-module progress, mark-complete with percent recompute, notes CRUD, resource downloads, progress ring.

### Admin OS (S3) — 23 routes, all functional
KPI dashboard (sparklines, revenue chart, bookings donut, approvals, customers, schedule), payments queue, orders lifecycle, bookings management, curriculum builder, publish toggles across all content, offers/coupons CRUD, reviews moderation, reports + snapshots, settings + feature flags (drive public nav), roles (owner-only), audit logs, security posture, system status.

### Backend (live)
Supabase project `azuvwkzpgtyxwxmvedmp` (eu-central-1): 18 migrations (000–017), ~60 tables, RLS on everything (integrity-hardened: order totals, payment amounts, notification guard, payload caps, atomic booking, durable rate limits), 7 storage buckets (signed-URL-only protected content), guarded Arabic demo seeder, hourly expiry cron. **Pre-existing real business data preserved** (moved to `legacy` schema) **and ported**: 2 sessions (١٬٢٠٠/١٬٥٠٠ ج.م), real Instapay number, brand settings. Owner role auto-grants to heba0elsherif@gmail.com on signup.

## Acceptance criteria (§15)
| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| Homepage ≥ S1, discovery ≥ S2, admin ≥ S3, learner ≥ S4 | ✅ four supplied references reviewed; system-level adaptation verified |
| Excellent RTL + mobile | ✅ RTL root + logical props; 26-route × 3-width zero-overflow sweep; drawer nav |
| No placeholders / broken routes / weak coming-soon | ✅ build-enforced (audit:ux, audit:routes) |
| No random colors | ✅ build-enforced (audit:colors) |
| No exposed private content / service key | ✅ build-enforced (audit:security) + live RLS validation |
| No package-lock.json; frozen-lockfile passes | ✅ |
| `pnpm run check:deploy` passes | ✅ (final run below) |
| Migrations + current hosting configuration | Historical only; current launch follows the Cloudflare Workers gate |
| Clean repo | ✅ docs complete, decision log, tagged releases |

## Commands run (final)
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` ✅ · `pnpm check:deploy` ✅ · live API/RLS validation suite ✅ (TEST_REPORT.md)

## Known limitations
1. Courses/books/workshops catalog is empty on the live site (by design — honest empty states); content creation is an owner task via the admin OS.
2. Receipt authenticity remains a human-review decision; amounts, ownership, state, file type and audit trail are enforced automatically.

## Launch steps for the owner
DEPLOYMENT.md checklist: push to GitHub → complete the Cloudflare owner setup → deploy the accepted commit through the Cloudflare runbook → set Supabase Auth Site URL, `ADMIN_LOGIN_EMAIL`, and email confirmation → add approved content → smoke-test the governed manual-payment route end-to-end.
